  				Sydney, the biggest city in Australia. Everything's so big and so complex. Especially the Central Station. When I arrived in there I was totally shocked. 21 platforms! Never seen so many in my life. And every street is extremely busy. Alright, I have
  				to head for the hostel to put my luggage so that everything will be easier.
  			</p>
  			<p>
  				The hostel located near the small beach which probably few backpackers knows about it -- Coogee Beach. I only checked one bus called "M50" and saved a screenshot in my phone, so I had to find the bus since I had no Internet. Well, or since I
  				was too self-confident. So I spent 2 hours, dragging my 36kg luggage, running in circle and asking around Central station, but just couldn't find any signs showing M50. I did find one, but it was in the wrong direction. That luggage nearly killed
  				me, and I'll swear I'll never do that again.
  			</p>
  			<p>
  				When I finally arrived at Coogee Beach, it was already 2pm. I rang the hostel's doorbell, no one answered. I looked up to the sign near the door. "Office Hour: 9am-1pm, 5pm-10pm" Wait, what? They have lunch break? So I just dragged my luggage
  				again back to the beach. I was so tired but I couldn't sleep. I felt so insecure about my stuff will get stolen anytime.
  			</p>
  			<p class="switch">
  				&nbsp;
  			</p>
  			<p class="pin_trigger"></p>
  			<div class="pin_point">
  				<p>
  					I walked down to the beach. Sat down on the bench. Staring at the crowd playing beach ball, lying in the sand, enjoying every piece of sunshine.
  				</p>
  				<p>&nbsp;
  				</p>
  				<p>I’ve never felt so confused about my life. Few days ago I was still struggling in the last lines of my coding, arguing with my supervisor. And now I’m suddenly here, enjoying the freedom at last. Or is this all real?
  				</p>
  			</div>
  			<p>&nbsp;
  			</p>

  			<p>Finally they let me in. The hostel wasn’t quite big. I thought there should be an elevator or something, but again, I had to walk up the stairs wth my 36kg luggage. That was the longest day of my life, fortunately a guy gave me a hand and guided
  				me to the reception, which was on the top floor. Finally! But the guy at the reception told me I have to pay like 40 AUD more beside the deposit. What? I thought I pay all of it online already! The traveler cheques are the only thing I had with me.
  			</p>
  			<p>“Do you accept credit cards? Or traveler’s cheques……?”
  			</p>
  			<p>“No. Sorry we only accept cash.”
  			</p>
  			<p>It was nearly 6pm, so I rushed downstairs and finally found a bank on the street, which was so nice to open the door for me before it closed. Otherwise I’ll be homeless.
  			</p>
  			<p>“We’re closing now, but you’re a backpacker, I will open the door for you. I know backpackers need money.”
  			</p>
  			<p>That was the warmest words for my life!
  			</p>


  			<p class="switch">
  				&nbsp;
  			</p>
  			<h2>23.03.2013
  			</h2>
  			<p>&nbsp;
  			</p>
  			<p>That was a very nice beach town. I watched the sunrise from the window. Everything was so peaceful like a picture.
  			</p>
  			<p>So after arriving in Australia, the first thing to do is get three numbers: Phone Number, Tax File Number and Bank Account Number. I had to get phone number first, plus I didn’t want to keep my family worried. So I bought a SIM card in the store
  				and tried to activate it. That was my first time having a conversation in English, and guess what? The costumer service had a very strong accent, so I totally couldn’t understand what he was talking about. He had to repeat every question 3 times
  				until I understand what he was talking about. So he went crazy, and I went crazy, too.
  			</p>
  			<p>Finally got it done. So I hopped on the bus and went straight to the city centre.
